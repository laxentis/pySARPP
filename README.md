pySARPP
=======

Python program to interpret DCS Mig-21bis SARPP data

##Requirements
* Python 3
* PyQt4
* Matplotlib
* Numpy

##Usage

> python Sarpp.py

On Windows:
You can use the Windows build (not always up to date) located in the *dist* folder. This version runs just like a regular exe.

To use the most up to date version:
* Install [Anaconda Python 3.4](http://continuum.io/downloads#py34) (You can ommit this step if you have a working Python 3.4 install with the requirements met)
* Run the script from command line as in the example above
